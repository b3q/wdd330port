        <h3>Object Methods "This" - Notes:</h3>
        <h4>The consequences of unbound this</h4>
        <p>If you come from another programming language, then you are probably used to the idea of a "bound this", where methods defined in an object always have this referencing that object.</p>

        <p>In JavaScript this is “free”, its value is evaluated at call-time and does not depend on where the method was declared, but rather on what object is “before the dot”.</p>

        <p>The concept of run-time evaluated this has both pluses and minuses. <strong>On the one hand, a function can be reused for different objects. On the other hand, the greater flexibility creates more possibilities for mistakes.</strong></p>

        <p>Here our position is not to judge whether this language design decision is good or bad. We’ll understand how to work with it, how to get benefits and avoid problems.</p>

        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Functions that are stored in object properties are called “methods”.</li>
            <li>Methods allow objects to “act” like object.doSomething().</li>
            <li>Methods can reference the object as this.</li>
            <li>The value of this is defined at run-time.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            When a function is declared, it may use this, but that this has no value until the function is called.
            A function can be copied between objects.
            When a function is called in the “method” syntax: object.method(), the value of this during the call is object.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Please note that arrow functions are special: they have no this. When this is accessed inside an arrow function, it is taken from outside</strong></p>

        <h3>Objects - Notes:</h3>
        <p><strong>All objects are mutable at any time when a program is running.</strong> This means that its properties and methods can be changed or removed, and new properties and methods can be added to the object, even if it was declared using const .</p>
