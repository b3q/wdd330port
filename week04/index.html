        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <h4>Object Oriented Programming - Composition Over Inheritance</h4>
        <p>
            A design pattern that seeks to solve these problems is to use 'composition over inheritance'. This approach <strong> advocates creating small objects that describe single tasks or behaviors and using them as the building blocks for more complex objects</strong>. This is similar to the idea of pure functions that we discussed in the last chapter. These single-task objects are easier to test and maintain and can be combined together, using a mixin function, to create more complex objects. Composition over inheritance sees objects as building blocks that go together to make other objects rather than classes that are monolithic structures layered on top of each other.
        </p>
        <h4>Modular Javascript</h4>
        <p>
            A module is a self-contained piece of code that provides functions and methods that can then be used in other files and by other modules. This helps to keep code organized in separate, reusable files, which improves code maintainability. <strong>The code in a module should have a single purpose, and group together functions with distinct functionality</strong>. For example, you might keep any functions used for Ajax in their own module. This could then be used in any projects where Ajax was required. Keeping code modular helps to make it moreloosely coupledand interchangeable, meaning you can easily swap one module for another without affecting other parts of a project. Indeed, small single-purpose modules are the exact opposite of large monolithic libraries as they enable developers to use only the modules that are needed, avoiding any wasted code. Modules also allow a public API to be exposed, while keeping the implementation hidden away inside the module.
